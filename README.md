# Problem Solving Repository

Welcome to my problem solving repository! This collection contains solutions to popular algorithmic challenges typically found on LeetCode. Each problem is implemented in Java with the goal of improving coding skills, algorithmic thinking, and familiarity with common interview questions.

Below is a schedule of the problems included here, listed by LeetCode number, problem name, and a brief description:

| LeetCode # | Problem Name                  | Description                                                                                   |
|------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1          | Two Sum                       | Given an array of integers, find two numbers that add up to a specific target number. Return their indices. |
| 136        | Single Number                 | Given a non-empty array of integers where every element appears twice except one, find that single one. |
| 387        | First Unique Character in a String | Find the first non-repeating character in a string and return its index. Return -1 if it doesn't exist. |
| 560        | Subarray Sum Equals K         | Count the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals a given integer k.            |
